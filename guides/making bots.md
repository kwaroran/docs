To create your character from scratch,
1. press + button in the left pannel, press "create from scratch" 
2. switch to "character" pannel
3. Set the name of your character. we recommend to be short, otherwise it cause bad influence to AI.

5. Set the first message, also known as greeting. do not put user's move or speech here, otherwise it cause bad influence to AI.
