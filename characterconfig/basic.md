# Basics

On the basics tab you can set the basic information about your character.

## Character Name

The name of your character. This is the name that will be displayed in and used. This name would used by AI very often, so make sure to choose a name that is easy to remember and pronounce.

It is recommended to use a short name rather than a full name. putting a full name can confuse AI and make it harder to remember. like "John" instead of "John Doe". put a full name in the description section instead if you want.


## Character Description

A description of your character. Write short or long description of your character. The description would be used by AI every time. It is recommended to write in a way that AI can understand better. For example:

```
Basic Information:
- Name: John
- Age: 25
- Occupation: Student

Physical Description:
- Height: 6'2"
- Weight: 45kg
- Hair: Brown
- Eyes: Blue
```

for detailed description, it is recommended to use [Lorebooks](/characterconfig/lorebook).

## First Message

First message that would appear when you start a conversation with your character.

First message is important for AI, because it sets the tone of the conversation and helps AI to understand the character better.

## Author's Note

A note that would AI would consider very importantly. It is recommended to write a note that how the conversation should go, if you want to make AI to follow a specific path. for example: `John will go to the park and meet his friend.`

Author's note is chat-dependent, not character-dependent. So, you can write different notes for different chats. and it wouldn't be exported with the character.
