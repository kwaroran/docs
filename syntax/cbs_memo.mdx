## Power Syntaxes

> Available only 2.0.0 and later

Power syntaxes are syntaxes that are used to interact with the AI and the client directly. Since they uses large amount of resources, they have restrictions on usage, and its recommended to use them if you understand how they work.

### `{{ai_response::A}}`

This will be replaced with the AI's response to the provided input `A`. The main model will be used to generate the response. The `airesponse` permission should be enabled to use this syntax, and would only work on regex scripts or trigger scripts, which isn't display/translation modification scripts. 3 operations per process limit would be applied to this syntax. if operation limit is reached, it will be replaced with empty string.

### `{{axai_response::A}}`

This will be replaced with the AI's response to the provided input `A`. The auxiliary model will be used to generate the response. The `airesponse` permission should be enabled to use this syntax. It would only work on regex scripts or trigger scripts, which isn't display/translation modification scripts. 3 operations per process limit would be applied to this syntax. if operation limit is reached, it will be replaced with empty string.

### `{{vector::A::B}}`

This will be replaced with the closest vector to `A` in the array `B`. The `B` should be an array of strings. It would only work on regex scripts or trigger scripts, which isn't display/translation modification scripts. 3 operations per process limit would be applied to this syntax. if operation limit is reached, it will be replaced with first element of `B`. if `B` is empty, it will be replaced with empty string.

### `{{image_generation::A}}`

This will be replaced with the generated image from the provided input `A`. The `imagegeneration` permission should be enabled to use this syntax. It would only work on regex scripts or trigger scripts, which isn't display/translation modification scripts. 1 operations per process limit would be applied to this syntax. if operation limit is reached, it will be replaced with empty string.

### `{{fetch::A}}`

This will be replaced with the content of the provided URL `A`. The `fetch` permission should be enabled to use this syntax. 5 operations per process limit would be applied to this syntax. if operation limit is reached, it will be replaced with empty string.

The request would made by `fetch()` function in the client, with GET method.

### `{{fetch_post::A::B}}`

This will be replaced with the content of the provided URL `A` with the provided body `B`. The `fetch` permission should be enabled to use this syntax. 5 operations per process limit would be applied to this syntax. if operation limit is reached, it will be replaced with empty string.

The request would made by `fetch()` function in the client, with POST method.

### `{{permission::A}}`

This will be replaced with `1` if the permission `A` is enabled, otherwise it will be replaced with `0`.

### `{{request_permission::A}}`

This will be displayed as permission request dialog for the permission `A`. this syntax would only work on first message of the chat, and without modifying the message. this would be replaced with empty string when used in other messages, or sending the message.

The permission list is as follows:
- `airesponse`: Allows to use `{{ai_response::A}}` and `{{axai_response::A}}` syntaxes.
- `imagegeneration`: Allows to use `{{image_generation::A}}` syntax.
- `fetch`: Allows to use `{{fetch::A}}` and `{{fetch_post::A::B}}` syntaxes.
- `js`: Allows to use character javascript scripts.
